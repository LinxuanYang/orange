Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.


```python
namedic={}

class Codec:
    
    def encode(self,longUrl):
        res="http://tinyurl.com/"
        for i in longUrl.split("/"):
            if i!='':
                res+=i[0]
        count=0
        while res in namedic.values():
            res+=longUrl[-1-count]
        namedic[res]=longUrl
        print(namedic)
        return res
        

    def decode(self,shortUrl):
        if shortUrl in namedic:
            return namedic[shortUrl]
        
url="https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/"
codec=Codec()
print("this is long:",codec.decode(codec.encode(url)))
        
url2="https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/8888888"
codec2=Codec()
print("this is long:",codec2.decode(codec2.encode(url2)))
```

    {'http://tinyurl.com/hlpe': 'https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/'}
    this is long: https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/
    {'http://tinyurl.com/hlpe': 'https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/', 'http://tinyurl.com/hlpe8': 'https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/8888888'}
    this is long: https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/8888888
