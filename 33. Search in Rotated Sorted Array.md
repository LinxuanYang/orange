Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1


```python
def search(A, n, target):
    lo=0
    hi=n-1
    #find the index of the smallest value using binary search
    while(lo<hi):
        mid=(lo+hi)//2
        if A[mid]>A[hi]:
            lo=mid+1
        else:
            hi=mid
    rot=hi
    return rot

def binarysearch(alist,low,high,target):
    while(low<=high):
        
        mid=(low+high)//2
        if A[mid]>target:
            high=mid-1
        elif A[mid]<target:
            low=mid+1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1

def console(A,target):
    rot = search(A,len(A),target)
    if A[0]<=target<=A[rot-1]:
        return binarysearch(A,0,rot-1,target)
    else:
        return binarysearch(A,rot,len(A)-1,target)

    
A=[4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2]
target=1
print(console(A,target))
```
