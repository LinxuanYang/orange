```python
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```


```python
lst=[3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6]
def kth(lst,k):
    lst.sort(reverse=True)
    return lst[k-1]
print(kth(lst,4))
```

    4
