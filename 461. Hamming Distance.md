The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.


```python
def hummingdis(x,y):
    xb,yb=list(bin(x)[2:]),list(bin(y)[2:])
    diff=len(yb)-len(xb)
    xb=['0']*diff+xb
    print(xb)
    print(yb)
    count=0
    for i in range(len(xb)):
        if xb[i]!=yb[i]:
            count+=1
    return count
x=1
y=4
print(hummingdis(x,y))
```
