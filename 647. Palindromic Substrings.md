Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

A DP solution to this problem is to build a table with all possible string[start:end] combinations, storing which are palindromes and which are not (True or False). At any given moment, when you're checking if string[i:j] is a palindrome, you only need to know two things:

Is string[i] equal to string[j]?
Is string[i+1:j-1] a palindrome?
For condition (1), a simple check might do, for condition (2), you use the table. If both conditions are met, mark table[i][j] as True and increase your count.

Here's the code:



```python
def countSubstrings(s):
    if not s:
        return 0

    n = len(s)
    table = [[False for x in range(n)] for y in range(n)]
    print(table)
    count = 0

    # Every isolated char is a palindrome
    for i in range(n):
        table[i][i] = True
        count += 1
    print("1:",table)
    # Check for a window of size 2
    for i in range(n-1):
        if s[i] == s[i+1]:
            table[i][i+1] = True
            count += 1

    # Check windows of size 3 and more
    for k in range(3, n+1):
        for i in range(n-k+1):
            j = i+k-1
            if table[i+1][j-1] and s[i] == s[j]:
                table[i][j] = True
                count += 1

    return count
s="abcaa"
print(countSubstrings(s))
```

    [[False, False, False, False, False], [False, False, False, False, False], [False, False, False, False, False], [False, False, False, False, False], [False, False, False, False, False]]
    1: [[True, False, False, False, False], [False, True, False, False, False], [False, False, True, False, False], [False, False, False, True, False], [False, False, False, False, True]]
